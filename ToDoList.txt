  recommendation from another peer review:
    "On the prereq page, add an equivalent 
    course background which would be indicate necessary knowledge to do well with 
    this app. (ie. STAT 414 etc.) Maybe offer a link to a textbook or video 
    if someone wanted to extend/supplement their learning." - pophillips
